# Guide to Setting Up and Running the Application

This guide provides instructions on how to set up and run the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python:** Verify your Python installation by running `python --version` in your terminal.  We recommend using Python 3.6 or higher.
*   **pip:** Python's package installer.  It usually comes with Python.  You can check if it's installed by running `pip --version`.
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.  You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    \`\`\`bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    \`\`\`

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.

    \`\`\`bash
    python -m venv venv
    \`\`\`

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   On macOS and Linux:

        \`\`\`bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        \`\`\`

    *   On Windows:

        \`\`\`bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        \`\`\`

4.  **Install the dependencies:**

    \`\`\`bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    \`\`\`

## Running the Application

1.  **Set environment variables:**

    The application may require certain environment variables to be set.  Refer to the `README.md` or configuration files for details.  For example:

    \`\`\`bash
    export API_KEY="your_api_key"
    \`\`\`

2.  **Run the main script:**

    \`\`\`bash
    python main.py
    \`\`\`

    Replace `main.py` with the actual name of the main script.

## Code Examples

Here are some code examples:

\`\`\`python
# Example 1: Basic function
def greet(name):
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
\`\`\`

\`\`\`python
# Example 2: Reading a file
with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
  data = f.read()
  print(data)
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

*   **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '...'":** This usually means you haven't installed the required dependencies. Make sure you've activated the virtual environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
*   **"Command not found":**  Ensure that Python and pip are correctly installed and added to your system's PATH.  Try running `python --version` and `pip --version` to verify.
*   **Permission errors:** If you encounter permission errors, try running the commands with `sudo` (on Linux/macOS) or as an administrator (on Windows).  However, it's generally better to fix the underlying permission issues.
*   **Virtual environment issues:** If you're having trouble with the virtual environment, try deleting the `venv` directory and recreating it.  Make sure you activate the environment before installing dependencies.
