System Overview
---------------

The GRA Core Platform is built on a modern, cloud-native architecture designed for:

* **High Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
* **Scalability**: Auto-scaling based on demand
* **Security**: Bank-grade security controls
* **Performance**: Sub-100ms response times
* **Compliance**: SOX, PCI DSS, and other regulations

Architecture Principles
-----------------------

**Microservices Architecture**
   * Loosely coupled services
   * Independent deployment
   * Technology diversity
   * Fault isolation

**Event-Driven Design**
   * Asynchronous communication
   * Event sourcing patterns
   * CQRS implementation
   * Message queues

**API-First Approach**
   * RESTful APIs
   * GraphQL endpoints
   * OpenAPI specifications
   * Versioning strategy

Core Components
---------------

**API Gateway**
   * Request routing and load balancing
   * Authentication and authorization
   * Rate limiting and throttling
   * API versioning and documentation

**Service Mesh**
   * Service-to-service communication
   * Traffic management
   * Security policies
   * Observability

**Data Layer**
   * PostgreSQL for transactional data
   * MongoDB for document storage
   * Redis for caching
   * Elasticsearch for search

**Message Queue**
   * Apache Kafka for event streaming
   * RabbitMQ for task queues
   * Dead letter queues
   * Message ordering

Infrastructure
--------------

**Container Orchestration**
   * Kubernetes clusters
   * Docker containers
   * Helm charts
   * Auto-scaling policies

**Cloud Services**
   * AWS/Azure hybrid cloud
   * CDN for static assets
   * Load balancers
   * DNS management

**Monitoring & Observability**
   * Prometheus metrics
   * Grafana dashboards
   * ELK stack for logging
   * Distributed tracing

Security Architecture
---------------------

**Authentication & Authorization**
   * OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
   * JWT tokens
   * Role-based access control
   * Multi-factor authentication

**Network Security**
   * VPC isolation
   * Security groups
   * WAF protection
   * DDoS mitigation

**Data Protection**
   * Encryption at rest and in transit
   * Key management service
   * Data classification
   * Backup and recovery

Deployment Strategy
-------------------

**Blue-Green Deployment**
   * Zero-downtime deployments
   * Quick rollback capability
   * Production validation
   * Traffic switching

**Canary Releases**
   * Gradual feature rollout
   * A/B testing capability
   * Risk mitigation
   * Performance monitoring
